            <p style="color: #e6eef5; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                Throughout my Computer Science program, I've gained a strong foundation in software engineering,
                systems level thinking, and problem solving that has prepared me to enter the field as a strong and capable professional.
                Completing my capstone project has pushed me to connect class learned theory with a mobile application that holds a real life use case, 
                demonstrating my technical strengths, and diving into worlds outside of tech, such as human psychology. Understanding the human mind has been
                a strong focus for me in my development processes. As I approach graduation, my focus is on continuing to build strong
                software engineering projects until I am able to contribute meaningfully to my future employer.

                <h3>Program Growth & Professional Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My coursework has strengthened my technical knowledge, taught me to work through pressure, and reinforced my career
                    goals. Through my coursework, I've realized how much I love to build software. Though sometimes painful, figuring out
                    how to piece together complex systems and debugging them is extremely rewarding. Developing my capstone has pushed me to incorporate a wide range
                    of concepts into one project, increasing my ability as a fullstack engineer. My time as Southern New Hampshire University, and especially this capstone, 
                    has reinforced my desire to be a Software Engineer. I am excited to continue building software and learning new technologies in a professional
                    environment.

                <h3>Collaboration in Team Environments</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaboration was a key component of my academic experience. Collaborating with other students weekly
                    helped change the way I approach problem-solving. When going through other student's discussion posts, I would
                    often see ideas I would have never thought of, and I learned to incorporate those ideas into my own work. I also learned how to communicate
                    technical concepts to others, and how to ask for help when I needed it. I have always been the type of person to want to figure things out on my own, 
                    but I learned that often times, getting a different perspective can quickly get you unstuck and even lead to better solutions overall.

                <h3>Data Structures & Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    My understanding of data structures and algorithms was really pushed as I've approached the end of my coursework.
                     In my capstone, I implemented a Min/Max algorithm to analyze weight trends and label the axes of the chart effectively. Without understanding 
                     algorithms this task would have been nearly impossible to dynamically complete. My understanding of data structures also allowed me to
                     ensure my app was running efficiently, and that I was using the right data structures for the right tasks.
                     I have recently began developing a game in Unity, and data structures have been crucial to manage in game objects, inventory systems, and even player progress. 
                     Overall, data structures and algorithms 
                     are key to have efficently running software and is something I have spent countless hours learning (thanks Leetcode!) to become a better developer.

                        Also created a goal widget, analyzing the user's current weight versus their end goal and color coordinating results based on current progress. </p>
